Strategy-Game
=============

Repository for Lawrence's group project

The project we are creating is a resource management strategy game in which the player creates armies, takes over land, and creates diplomatic relations with other nations.  The purpose of the game is to either acquire all opposing nations through warfare or create alliances such that there are no enemies to oppose you and your allies.
