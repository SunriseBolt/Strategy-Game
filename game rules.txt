COMBAT

combat behaves in ticks where rolls are made against each other.

it averages the attack, defence values and sets that as the armies attack and defence values per thousand, then multiply it by the ration of Army size/1000.
the Armies Max morale (of the nations max morale (AMM)) is
.2*AMM + .8*AMM*(Infantry/1000) 

an Army loses when their morale becomes 0 or their army force number becomes 0.

damage per tick is basically a 10 sides dice plus the Average army attack, minus the enemy armies roll + defence.
sqr(1d10 + AA)-sqr(1d10 + EAD)
